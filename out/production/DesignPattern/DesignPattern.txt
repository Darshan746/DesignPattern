Creational design patterns provide solution to instantiate a object in the best possible way for specific situations.

Structural patterns provide different ways to create a class structure,
for example using inheritance and composition to create a large object from small objects.

Behavioral patterns provide solution for the better interaction between objects
and how to provide lose coupling and flexibility to extend easily.


To implement the solution, let’s design one participant one at a time.

ISocialMediaStrategy – The interface which abstract the operation.
SocialMediaContext – The context which determines the implementation.
Implementations – Various implementations of ISocialMediaStrategy. E.g. FacebookStrategy, GooglePlusStrategy, TwitterStrategy and OrkutStrategy.
