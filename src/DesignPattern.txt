Creational design patterns provide solution to instantiate a object in the best possible way for specific situations.

Structural patterns provide different ways to create a class structure,
for example using inheritance and composition to create a large object from small objects.

Behavioral patterns provide solution for the better interaction between objects
and how to provide lose coupling and flexibility to extend easily.
