The State Pattern is a behavioral design pattern which allows an object to alter its behavior
 when its internal state changes. 
The object will appear to change its class.


And State Pattern is an alternative to putting lots of conditionals in your context by encapsulating the behaviours within state objects,
 you can simply change the state object in context to change its behaviour.

Would I Use This Pattern?

You should use the State pattern when the behaviour of an object should be influenced by it's state, 
and when complex conditions tie object behaviour to it's state.
