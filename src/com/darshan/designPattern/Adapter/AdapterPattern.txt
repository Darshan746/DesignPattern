Its provide a bridge between 2 incompatible interfaces

Its Structural design pattern

the adapter pattern makes two incompatible interfaces compatible without changing their existing code.

Target Interface: This is the desired interface class which will be used by the clients.

Adapter class: This class is a wrapper class which implements the desired target interface and modifies the specific request available from the Adaptee class.

Adaptee class: This is the class which is used by the Adapter class to reuse the existing functionality and modify them for desired use.

Client: This class will interact with the Adapter class.


Adapter class should implements the target interface and have the object reference of Adaptee
